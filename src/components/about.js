      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2006, the main focus of the STARx Program is to develop and
        improve self-management skills and disease knowledge among adolescents
        and young adults with chronic health conditions. We have created
        self-management and transition readiness assessment tools that identify
        areas of knowledge and skill deficits among patients ages 12 and older.
        Based on identified areas of need, education and intervention is then
        provided in an individualized, culturally, linguistically and
        age-appropriate fashion.
